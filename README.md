# Dynamic Django Base

## INTRO
**A base starter project - pages and website sections can appear dynamically anywhere you like on your website:**

**Created in the admin:**
- Flat Pages 
  - Create pages such as 'about us'.
  - Dynamically appear in the navbar, sidebar and footer.
- Website sections 
  - Title, text, url and image of any django apps you create.
  - Dynamically appear on the homepage as a grid.
  - You can categorize the sections.
  - Appear under category headings in sidebar and footer.

- When you create a new django app, you can add information about the app as a website section with text, image and url.
- You can load the tags (from template tags) to include website sections and categories anywhere you like in your project.

## FEATURES

Completely adpatable, the base project consists of:

- Base HTML

For these demo images, I created two flat pages and three website sections that appear under two website categories:

- Base HTML file with a sidebar:

- Base HTML full width page with a website sections grid:
